Hacker News post mining for show HN and Ask HN posts
Hacker News is a site where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon.

We have a data set for the posts of hacker newÿ≥. But note that it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
